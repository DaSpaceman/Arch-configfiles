Anything below this number across all RGB components is considered black.\n      Black level can decrease if we detect darker blacks in the video. Lower values —> more accurate edge detection;\n      higher values —> detection is more forgiving to videos with less-than-ideal contrast ratios.<br/>\n      <b>Threshold:</b> If pixel is darker than the sum of black level and this value, it's considered black.

'Strict' and 'Lax' prevent aspect ratio\n      changes if we detected gradients instead of a legit edge. This results in fewer false positives, but may cause aspect ratio\n      detection to not work on darker frames.<br/>\n      <b>Image threshold:</b> When gradient detection is enabled, everything that's brighter than the sum of black level, threshold and\n      ths is considered to be non-black.<br/>\n      <b>Gradient threshold:</b> If the distance between last black pixel and the first non-black pixel in a given column is more than this value,\n      we're looking at a gradient.

This test prevents\n        us from wasting precious time trying to detect aspect ratio on frames that are too dark for reliable aspect ratio detection.<br/>\n        <b>Sample width, height:</b> Sample size. Since we're checking <i>every</i> pixel in this sample, dimensions should be kept small.<br/>\n        <b>Color variance treshold:</b> In videos (such as movie trailers), any text that appears on the black background is usually of\n        a roughly the same color, while dark movie footage is not. This allows us to trigger autodetection on dark movie footage and \n        to not trigger autodetection when movie trailer flashes some text on black background. If color variance is greater than this value,\n        blackframe detection will use 'lax' (lower) cummulative threshold to determine whether the frame is black or not. If color variance\n        is less than this value, 'strict' (higher) cummulative threshold will be used to determine whether the frame is black or not instead.<br/>\n        <b>Cumulative threshold:</b> If we add the maximum of red, green, blue values of every pixel in the sample and they total more than this, the frame is bright enough.\n        Comes in 'lax' and 'strict' versions.
